When I'm working from home, this 2x3m room is where I do all of my work, including my remote job, freelance projects, and side projects.

This is my current workspace:

  height={1086}
/>

One of the most important things for me when working from home is having the right tools. So, let's start with my main device - the computer.

## Computer

| Name       | Detail                        |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| OS         | Windows 10 Pro 64-bit         |
| Proccessor | Intel Core i5-4460 Quad Cores |
| RAM        | 8192MB DDR3                   |
| GPU        | HD Graphics 4600              |

The specs on this computer might not be top-of-the-line, but it's more than enough to get the job done when it comes to web development.

And just for fun, I actually use this computer to work on React Electron projects and it performs just fine.
