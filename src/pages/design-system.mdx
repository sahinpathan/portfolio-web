## Design Token

The design token used is the [default configuration](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blob/master/stubs/defaultConfig.stub.js) of the Tailwind CSS itself, although it needs some tweaking.

In practice, they are enough for simple sites like a personal site like this.

## Typography

This site only uses two variable fonts:

1. **Plus Jakarta Sans**, for the main content and UI.
2. **JetBrains Mono**, for code-related text.

Here's the preview for JetBrains Mono font:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

## Color

The default Tailwind CSS [color palette](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) is impressive. The colors used for the site colors scheme are `slate` and `white`.

While the accent colors used are `violet` (primary) and `blue` (secondary).
