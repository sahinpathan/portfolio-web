## Typography

This site only uses two variable fonts: **JetBrains Mono** for code-related text and **Plus Jakarta Sans**, which is enough to fit with the UI and content.

Thanks to [Tokotype](https://www.tokotype.com/) for the great work so that the **Plus Jakarta Sans** font can be used on this site with great results!

If you are interested in seeing the font, please visit the official site [here](https://tokotype.github.io/plusjakarta-sans/) for the Plus Jakarta Sans font and [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) for the JetBrains Mono font.

## Color Scheme

The colors scheme of this site are also taken from the default Tailwind CSS [color pelette](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors), which is sufficient and impressive.

The colors used for the colors scheme are `slate` and `white`. While the accent colors used are `violet` (primary) and `blue` (secondary).
