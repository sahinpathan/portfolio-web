## Typography

This site only uses two variable fonts: **JetBrains Mono** for code-related text and **Plus Jakarta Sans**, which is enough to fit with the UI and content.

Here's the preview for JetBrains Mono font:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

If you are interested in seeing the font, please visit the official site [here](https://tokotype.github.io/plusjakarta-sans/) for the Plus Jakarta Sans font and [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) for the JetBrains Mono font.

## Color Scheme

The colors scheme of this site are also taken from the default Tailwind CSS [color pelette](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors), which is sufficient and impressive.

The colors used for the colors scheme are `slate` and `white`. While the accent colors used are `violet` (primary) and `blue` (secondary).
