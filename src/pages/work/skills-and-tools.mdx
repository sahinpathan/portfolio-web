I started my career as a web developer about **{new Date().getFullYear() - 2016} years ago**. I've tried some programming languages and tech stack, both Back-End, and Front-End.

## Specialities

Even though the scope of web development is broad, I was very interested and focused on **Front-End Development** and **UI/UX Design**.

I really enjoy creating something that is clean and minimalistic, attractive and has value, and of course, easy to use.

I like when I create websites that have a lot of UI components, such as:

- Web application
- Dashboard layouts
- Fancy landing pages
- And others.

So, what tools did I feel comfortable using during the website creation?

### TypeScript

First of all, the programming language. Although website creation can be done using PHP, Python, etc., I'm very used to using TypeScript.

This JavaScript superset language has accompanied me for **about {new Date().getFullYear() - 2018} years**.

### React

React seems to have become a mandatory library for creating a website.
